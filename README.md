## Features

- **Payment security**: We are [PCI compliant](https://docs.reepay.com/docs/pci-certified), which makes it simple for you to collect sensitive data such as credit card numbers. This means the sensitive data is sent directly to Reepay instead of passing through your server.

- **Apple Pay**: We provide a [seamless integration with Apple Pay](https://docs.reepay.com/reference/apple-pay) through Reepay Checkout.

- **SCA-ready**: The SDK automatically performs native 3D Secure authentication to comply with [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) regulation in Europe.

## Releases

We support Cocoapods, Carthage, and Swift Package Manager.

If you link library manually, use a version from our [releases](https://github.com/reepay/reepay-ios/releases) page and make sure to embed following frameworks:

- `ReepayCheckoutSheet.xcframework`
